OpenCL Performance on the Intel Heterogeneous Architecture Research Platform Source Code

This repository is a subset of the code used for my research on the Intel Heterogeneous Architecture Platform (HARP).
You can find more details on my research by reviewing my publication at the 2020 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Virtual Conference (HPEC) or my Master's Thesis from Washington University in Saint Louis.
